I am an interdisciplinary technology professional with background in psychology and human-computer interaction. My main interest is in studying the complex and constantly evolving relationships between people and the technology they use; how our needs shape the technology which in turn shapes us and our societies.'

I received the degree "Master of Applied Science in Human-Computer Interaction" from Carleton University in 2020 and "Bachelor of Science in Psychology" from Trent University in 2015.

Here is an unordered list of tech topics that I am interested in:
  - Digital minimalism
  - Right to repair
  - Linux
  - Free/Libre Software movement
  - Game design/development
  - Usability/UX


And non-tech interests:
  - Veganism and Animal Rights
