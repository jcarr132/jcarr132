### Hi, I'm Josh! :wave:

ðŸŸ¨ â¬œ ðŸŸª â¬›

I'm an interdisciplinary technology professional with background in cognitive psychology and human-computer interaction. My main interest is in studying the complex and evolving relationships between people and the technology we use; how our needs shape the technologies that in turn shape us and our societies.

Here's an unordered list of technology topics that I'm interested in:
  - Linux and other open-source operating systems
  - Free/Libre Software movement
  - All vim everything
  - Digital minimalism
  - Right to repair
  - Programming languages
  - Digital privacy and cybersecurity
  - Game design/development
  - Usability/Accessibility
  - Technology & Mental Health
  
And some non-tech interests:
  - Veganism and Animal Liberation
  - LGBTQAI+ Rights
  - Cooking
  - Weird Music (mostly metal, post-rock, and chiptune)
  - Guitar + Piano
  - Gaming 
  - Generally being a reclusive introverted weirdo
