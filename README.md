### Hi, I'm Josh! :wave:

I'm an interdisciplinary technology professional with background in psychology and human-computer interaction. My main interest is in studying the complex and evolving relationships between people and the technology they use; how our needs shape the technologies which in turn shape us and our societies.

Here is an unordered list of tech topics that I am interested in:
  - Linux
  - Free/Libre Software movement  
  - Digital minimalism
  - Right to repair
  - Programming languages
  - Digital privacy and cybersecurity
  - Game design/development
  - Usability/Accessibility
  - Technology & Mental Health
  - VIM
  
And some non-tech interests:
  - Veganism and Animal Liberation
  - LGBTQAI+ Rights
  - Cooking
  - Weird Music (mostly metal, post-rock, and chiptunes)
  - Guitar + Piano
  - Gaming
